# Dynamic Skill Gap Analyzer

## Overview

The Dynamic Skill Gap Analyzer is a data engineering project powered by Gemini AI that analyzes and compares the skills in your resume against trending industry demands. The goal? To sniff out your skill gaps like a bloodhound and suggest how to fix them.

Think of it as a brutally honest career coachâ€”without the judgmental eyebrows.

## Old Features (RIP)

âœ… ~~Store skill data in **PostgreSQL** for historical analysis~~  
âœ… ~~Extract required job skills using **NLP (spaCy)**~~  
(We still love them, just... from afar.)

## New features

âœ… Identify missing skills for career improvement  
âœ… Create a dashboard for better visualizations
